# Rally-to-Trump
App to enable large gatherings of Trump supporters in large close-proximity environments

This app will direct and enable presently-alive Trump supporters (PATS) to exercise their Constitutional rights to gather in large numbers, in close proximity, for extended periods of times, without being muzzled by masks or other onerous government restrictions by directing them in real time to such patriotic rallies in their areas, giving them free reign to express and aerolize their opinions amongst each other as guaranteed by the 1st Amendment. Coding will be in Python 3.7 and APK generator using https://github.com/beeware. Please consider cloning. Timeline is no less than 21-days before first mail-in ballots are accepted by states at end of October. Deployment priority will be states known in the media as 'Red States', where PATS are most concentrated and therefore need being greatest to have such real time information delivered to them.
